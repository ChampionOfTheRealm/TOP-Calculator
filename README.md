# The Odin Project - Calculator

This is the final project for the The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The goal is to build a functioning calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Built to look like a Casio fx-9750G PLUS which just so happened to be on my desk when I started to develop the HTML and CSS.

Functionality follows The Odin Project guidelines for their calculator project. Thus why there are a number of buttons that are greyed out, their functionality was never implemented, though I may return to this in the future and add more.
